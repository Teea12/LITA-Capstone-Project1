### Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
This Project is about the Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store.
In this project, I analysed the sales performance of a retail store.
I explored sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional
performance, and monthly sales trends. I also produced an interactive Power BI
dashboard that highlighted the findings.

From both Reports above, the Region with the highest Total Sum of Sales is the South Region, and the Region with lowest Sum of Total Sales is the West.
From this Report, the marketing strategy and discounts need to be increased in the West so more people can buy more Products in the West Region.
Also from this Report, I can deduce that the People in the West Region cannot afford some Products due to high price.

From the both Reports, the month with the highest number of Total sales is February, and the month with the lowest number of Total Sales is September.
This may be due to the time when school children are on holidays, and they need to restock school items for the coming year, so nthere is more sales then.
The low sales in September maybe due to school children already restocked products for the school year, so therefore no need to buy products again.
