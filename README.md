This Project is about the Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store.
In this project, I analysed the sales performance of a retail store.
I explored sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional
performance, and monthly sales trends. I also produced an interactive Power BI
dashboard that highlighted the findings.
