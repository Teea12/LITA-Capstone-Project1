### Project Overview: 
This Project is about the Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store.
In this project, I analysed the sales performance of a retail store.
I explored sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional
performance, and monthly sales trends. I also produced an interactive Power BI
dashboard that highlighted the findings.


### Data Sources
The primary source of Data used on this project are Microsoft Excel, SQL database, and Power BI



### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel 
   1. For Data Cleaning
   2. For Analysis and
   3. For Data Visualization.

- SQL
   1. To write queries

- Power BI
  1. For data Visualizations.


### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following action;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which product are top sellers
- What are the product on peak sales
- Which Region has the highest total sales
- Which month was the highest in Total Sales

From both Reports above, the highest selling product is Shoes, and the lowest selling product is Socks.
From this Report, the highest selling product that customers love to buy is shoes.
From this Report, Customers like to buy shoes more than any other product in the store.


### Pivot Table Summary Report of Total Sales for each Region using Microsoft Excel

East	 2,450,000 

North	 1,950,000 

South	 4,675,000 

West	 1,512,500 

Grand Total	 10,587,500

From both Reports above, the Region with the highest Total Sum of Sales is the South Region, and the Region with lowest Sum of Total Sales is the West.
From this Report, the marketing strategy and discounts need to be increased in the West so more people can buy more Products in the West Region.
Also from this Report, I can deduce that the People in the West Region cannot afford some Products due to high price.

From the both Reports, the month with the highest number of Total sales is February, and the month with the lowest number of Total Sales is September.
This may be due to the time when school children are on holidays, and they need to restock school items for the coming year, so nthere is more sales then.
The low sales in September maybe due to school children already restocked products for the school year, so therefore no need to buy products again.
