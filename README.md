This Project is about the Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store.
In this project, I analysed the sales performance of a retail store.
I explored sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional
performance, and monthly sales trends. I also produced an interactive Power BI
dashboard that highlighted the findings.

From both Reports above, the highest selling product is Shoes, and the lowest selling product is Socks.
From this Report, the highest selling product that customers love to buy is shoes.
From this Report, Customers like to buy shoes more than any other product in the store.

From both Reports above, the Region with the highest Total Sum of Sales is the South Region, and the Region with lowest Sum of Total Sales is the West.
From this Report, the marketing strategy and discounts need to be increased in the West so more people can buy more Products in the West Region.
Also from this Report, I can deduce that the People in the West Region cannot afford some Products due to high price.
